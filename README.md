# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

There is some concern of bias towards some of the Amazon reviews by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. To analyze this data, the ETL(Extract Transform Load) process will be performed on a set of data. After the data is processed through the ETL method, the data will be split between Vine members and non-members, it will be analyzed by finding the total number of votes, the number of five-star votes, and the percentage of five-star votes of each; this will show some idea of the bias.
